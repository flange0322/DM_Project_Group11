Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.,food
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.,service
We were then shooed inside.,service
"One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.",service
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.,service
He offers subpar service and has no personality.,service

We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.,food

This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York.,food

You can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they don't make you by bottles.,service

The entree was also very good.,food
"Can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced.",food

Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu###beef.,food
Bison was quite excellent however.,food
Dessert: pure disaster.,food
Just not good at all.,food
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all.,food

After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner.,service
We asked for beverages and never received them.,service
We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.,service
My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.,food
I would not expect this for a $55 dinner.,food
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka!,service
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!,service
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!,service
To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.,service
"By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!",food
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible!,food
MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!,service

Great Indian food,food
"Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.",food
"Very ""normal Indian food"", but done really well.",food
"Also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.",service
I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).,service
"But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for Indian food",food
For starters they delivered us someone else's order.,service
"However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.",food
None was made so i hung up.,service
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.,food
Eat at your own risk.,food
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner,ambience
The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!,service

Too bad I had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl.,food
The nakgi-bokum was horrible.,food

"As to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made.",service
My wife had barely###touched that mess of a dish.,food
We were charged full price.,service
The wife had the risotto which was amazing.,food
The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.,food
i love margherita###pizza – i looove east village pizza,food
"The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.",food
"Personally I like the margherita###pizza better, but they are all good.",food

We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse###bouche.,food

The sake’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.,drinks
"For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.",food
"I don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I’ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.",ambience
"The service leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night.",service
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!!,service
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.,service
Great Shabu###Shabu,food
"But for the Shabu###Shabu, you won't find much better in NY.",food
Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork###belly tacos.,food
"The hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich, perfect on its supermarket squishy bun.",food
The food tasted very good.,food
The family seafood entree was very good.,food
The main entree was also very good.,food
"This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...",ambience
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work.,food
"The food they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked.",food
Good Food,food
Over all it was a very nice romantic place .,ambience
The atmosphere was great.,ambience
"Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio.",ambience
Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn.,service
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel###guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.,service
Polite acknowledgement is out;,service
supercilious scorn is in.,service
"And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?",service
"At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.",service
"We arrived and were seated###immediately, which made us both happy.",service
Everything was going good until we got our meals.,food
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled.,food
"It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed###potatoes.",food
"I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.",food
"At this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away.",service
"So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.",food
I couldn't even enjoy the mashed###potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.,food
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.,food
"Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, ""oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier"" No apology, nothing.",service
"After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!",service
"No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!",service
"This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.",service
"Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!",service
The level of rudeness was preposterous.,service
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED.,service
cirspy crust margherita###pizza,food
it was really good pizza.,food
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded:):):),food
It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.,ambience
Great Hot Dogs!,food
"Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food.",food
"The hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!",food
"Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!",food
Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu.,food
"But nonetheless--great spot, great food.",food
"As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!",service
The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink.,service
"I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she ""had a BBQ to go to"" that night - WTF??",service
I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!,service
"There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6"" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about.",service
"I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal.",service
"Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.",service
"Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service.",service
"So, if you're walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who's going to be seating you first...",service
"Maitre-D-""Eat and get out""",service
"While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.",drinks
"This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.",service
"His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.",service
"A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of "" table turnover"", as whacked as it is, or else.",service
"If you go here, do it on his off-night.",service
Best meal in a long time!,food
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening.,food
I had the Lamb special which was perfect.,food
"My father had the flank###steak which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish.",food
Taking Hot Dogs to the next level,food
"At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot###dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot###dog.",food
Here the hot###dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.,food
Great Atmosphere,ambience
"I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok.",food
Poor service and management,service
Appetizers took nearly an hour.,service
When the main###course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.,service
Never got an explanation as to what was going on.,service
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.,service
"When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.",service
"On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.",service
Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.,service
"On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.",service
"Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.",service
"The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.",food
So rude!!!,service
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.,service
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.,service
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.,service
"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""can I help you"" and ""how many are in your party.""",service
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.,service
Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.,service
bad staff,service
The food is good.,food
The design of the space is good.,ambience
But the service is HORRID!,service
"I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.",service
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.,service
"I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!",service
"The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet###peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).",service
"I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.",service
"She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.",service
"I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.",service
