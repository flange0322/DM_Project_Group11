The salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it.,software
They sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that I return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later.,support
If this is an improvement in Customer###Service then I would hate too see what it was before!,support
I spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person!,support

It took Toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem.,support

I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem.,support
I think I might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion.,support
And having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare.,support
They sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn't work.,support
And that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed.,support
Its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop.,support
After replacing the hard###drive the battery stopped working  (3 months of use) which was frustrating.,battery

I cannot be happier with the service or product.,support
after much effort and 10 days ASUS replaced it,support
The only objection I have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade.,os

"Ever since I bought this laptop, so far I've experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines.",support
I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed.,support
"Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them.",support
It's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them.,support
"And at one point, they blame me for installing a bad memory###stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop (I bought the memory###stick they recomended).",support
"Long###story###short, since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one, I didn't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year, they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services, they finally gave in.",support

even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty.,support
Dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture.,support
English must have been his third or fourth language.,support
"His language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test, and it was failing.",support
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me.,support
"After 4 days, being denied 6 times and told off once, I managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt.",support
Then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me.,support
"After they found no other way, they told me to courier it to them(since they don't allow the use of the post office) at my expense, and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn't be covered.",support
I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me.,support
They really do have the worlds very worst repair service.,support
"I Contacted HP  about this situation and was given excuses, without results.",support
They didn't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement.,support
"I did have to replace the battery once, but that was only a couple months ago and it's been working perfect ever since.",battery
I find myself using the 10-key more than I thought I would.,keyboard
Battery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos.,battery
I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it.,software
Once I removed all the software the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds.,software
Battery life needs more life.,battery
The only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2.0 hrs when not plugged in.,battery
I would like at least a 4 hr. battery life.,battery

I went to Toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it.,support
One of them seems to have worked.,support
The start###menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking.,os

Iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social###networking sites.,software

iLife is easily compatible with Microsoft###Office so you can send and receive files from a PC.,software
"In addition, all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations.",software
This comes in very handy for me as an educator.,software
iPhotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos.,software
It allows you to automatically upload photos to your Facebook account with one click.,software
"In addition, there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture.",software
"The system it comes with does not work properly, so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all.",os
"When calling Dell for help, reurn, or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it.",support
"For example, when my husband turns the light out while I'm on the computer. the screen brightness automatically adjusts.",display
It is VERY easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted.,keyboard

Very long-life battery (up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings).,battery
"I play a lot of casual games online, and the touchpad is very responsive.",mouse
The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook: screen size is not something I'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week.,display
Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point.,os
Everything I have tried has worked and I never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome.,battery
The Computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks.,support
I have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed.,support
Toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done.,support
I would tell the technician I knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in.,support
This computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions.,keyboard

"I use this for my tutoring business, and since I'm always bouncing from student to student, it is ideal for portability and battery life (yes, it gets the 8 hours as advertised!).",battery
I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba###Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty.,support
They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place.,support
And Toshiba is totally unconcerned.,support
The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter.,support
We don't Mind and You don't Matter.,support
When it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you don't matter.,support
Windows###Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service.,os
The technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother.,support
Just a bunch of idiots who's English as a 5th language is forced at best.,support
Can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display.,display
"The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual, but substantive.",os
"For the not so good, I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy.",display
It's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook.,display
The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it's a lie.,battery
I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it.,battery
The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours.,battery
Enabling the battery timer is useless.,battery
"The ""Time remaining"" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes.",battery
It's so bad that I'm thinking I only got half a battery or something.,battery
I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.,battery
"If you buy this - don't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life, and you'll be perfectly satisfied.",battery
"I love the easy to see screen, and It works well for work, persoal or just play.",display
I was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard doesn't light up on this model.,keyboard

The pictures are clear as can be.,display
"The acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it, but I like the big screen on it.",display
The only downfall is a lot of the software I have won't work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it.,software
It seems to be incompatible with everything else.,software
the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm.,software
The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly.,os
"The OS is also very user friendly, even for those that switch from a PC, with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS!",os
Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too.,software
It is light and the battery last a very long time.,battery
"I thought learning the Mac OS would be hard, but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC.",os
"the mouse on the pad, the left button always sticks.",mouse
the mouse is way way way to sensitve.,mouse
i tried turning it done but it did nothing.,mouse
the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too.,mouse
its not bad just VERY VERY annoying.,mouse
"The big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc!",display
"The flaws are, this computer is not for computer gamers because of the OS X.",os
BUT there's this application called Boot###Camp which allows you to add another OS X like Windows.,software
Was not happy with one of the programs on it.,software
"It was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer, was a six month trial.",software
"Overall the computer is very easy to use, the screen is perfect, great computer, my daughter loves.",display
The Internet###Explorer was very slow from the very beginning.,software
"It freezes, and it always shows that there is an error, so I have to restart it a few times every time I use it.",software
I tried to upgrade it to a newer###version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem.,software
"Well, I started using Google###Chrome, which is a little better, but it freezes too sometimes.",software
Another issue I have with it is the battery.,battery
Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden.,battery
"There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle, and when I click on it it says: "" Consider replacing your battery"" and it does not hold full charge.",battery
The screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution.,display
The only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible.,battery
They only stay charged a little over an hour.,battery
"Laptops are usually used on the go, so why not give you a better battery?",battery
The only thing is that the battery won't last more than 1/2 an hour.,battery
It discharges too quickly.,battery
I am ADDICTED to photo booth!,software
It is SO much fun to play with.,software
I work with kids and they love making short videos on there.,software
"I am able to organize my pics, music and files easily.",software
I love the keyboard.,keyboard
The display is awesome.,display
The display is beyond horrible.,display
I can not even read what I am writing half of the time.,display
"I bought this last week, and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch-mouse stopped responding.",mouse
Toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it.,support
TOSHIBA WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM.,support
"When I called Toshiba, they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $35 for the phone call, even though they didn't offer any technical support.",support
I loved the netbook (minus the fact that it was windows###OS) until this started happening.,os
"In those three years, I've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by Apple quickly and easily.",support
The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product.,software
First the screen goes completely out.,display
"Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up, not able to connect.",support
"Now the screen is going darker, darker, darker.",display
Screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive.,display
The only thing I would change about it is the mouse keys.,mouse
They click.,mouse
"sounds like a typewriter, but if you can get past that, this is a great laptop for a little money!",mouse
Vista is a nightmare.,os
It had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one.,mouse
Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel.,keyboard
It did not take long to get used to the Mac OS.,os
"I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for (Internet, artwork), and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable.",display
"iTunes is a handy music-management program, and it is essential for anyone with an iPod.",software
Toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it.,support
I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired.,support
Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty.,support
"The Final###Cut###Pro on this laptop is so fast and easy, and I can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer, which is also a mac.",software
"I do transcription work on the side, and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well.",keyboard
"The apple care has never failed me, and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well.",support
"I have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free, even without the warranty.",support
"The programs are great, like iphoto (love the editing capabilities), imail (which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad), imovie, etc.",software
She said its very user friendly.,software
I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing.,software
Since I've had this computer I've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth.,mouse
I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.,mouse
"The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it (iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iTunes, GarageBand) is all very helpful as well.",software
Each time taking about 1 day or so.,support
I had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly.,support
I had to pay for the shipping!,support
"i use my mac all the time, i love the software, the way it takes a short time to load things, how easy it is to use and most of all how you don't have to worry about viruses.",software
"All apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything, no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed.",support
"everything about a mac is wonderful, it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system, but you will learn fast and its all worth it.",os
3) Horrible customer support-they lost my laptop for a month-got it back 3 months later,support
"4) Laptop still did not work, blue###screen within a week...",support
The letter A stopped working after the first week.,keyboard
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return###policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase.,support
so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault.,support
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem.,support
they have not sent a new one nor called.,support
then on top of it all their cusromer service###center is in the middle east.,support
So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand.,support
"Then to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to.",support
Got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it.,support
3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications.,support
YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO AN AMERICAN WARRANTY SERVICE IS OUT OF COUNTRY.,support
That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed.,support
It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back.,support
ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke.,mouse
The battery life is probably an hour at best.,battery
Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product###key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good.,software
"Also, the battery does not last very long at all.",battery
I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem.,support
"Also, I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly.",keyboard
"Also, I have had alot of trouble with the shift###key to go to other lines.",keyboard
"It gets stuck all of the time you use it, and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work.",keyboard
Sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer.,display
None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing.,support
"They would repair one thing, send it back and it would still have the same problem.",support
"I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused, because they knew it was trouble.",support
I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty.,support
I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT.,support
I waited and waited and no laptop.,support
Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box.,support
"I waited another month for approval and for them to ""BUILD"" me a new laptop.",support
Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing.,support
HP didn't fix it.,support
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in.,support
They say sorry out of warranty.,support
Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period.,support
Now 17 months later they want (would not say exact amount) $165.00 to $400 to fix the machine.,support
They had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything.,support
Now the machine won't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.,support
"I had to call Apple 19 times (each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone), and take it to their store for evaluations, and diagnostics, 5 times.",support
"So I called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, I just chose to hide the message.",support
I custom ordered the machine from HP and could NOT understand the techie due to his accent.,support
"Although my model was listed as recalled, HP denied my claim.",support
"I bought it from HSN because it was ""bundled"" with extra software, but as it turns out, that software just crashes it more often.....",software
Spent 2 hours on phone with HP Technical Support.,support
"They went through asking me open up various components, taking battery out, hard###disk apart, and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it.",support
"Called tech support and got the usual Acer ""We don't support software but for $$$ we can help you"" I explained there was no software involved in booting.",support
"No, tey don't even support their own bios and it ""could be a problem with the bios"" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!",support
I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION.,support
But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE!!!,support
Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time.,support
This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.,support
"The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.",support
I'm tired of the inept service.,support
It didn't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better.,software
"It has a 10 hour battery life when you're doing web###browsing and word editing, making it perfect for the classroom or office, and in terms of gaming and movie playing it'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours.",battery
"However, the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary (unless you're gaming).",mouse
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have.,keyboard
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard.,keyboard
The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare.,mouse
I lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening.,mouse
"Also, the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it.",keyboard
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent...,battery
10 hours of battery life is really something else....,battery
tons of bloatware and junk programs.,software
can't reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers.,software
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed.,keyboard
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small.,keyboard
"The touchpad is very intuitive, so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again!",mouse
"Of course, I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork, GarageBand, and iMovie.",software
"The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets, and rather quickly too.",display
"They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer, not  what I've done.",support
"They told me to reprogram the computer, and I didn't need  to do that, and I lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her  life.",support
the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i've ever seen.,mouse
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move.,mouse
the mouse buttons are hard to push.,mouse
"So I called Compaq, and after being on the phone for 3 hours, i finally got a replacement which I shouldn't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty.",support
"2 months later, the battery went.",battery
"The people are frustrating to work with, the product itself is very cheaply made, and the accessories are less than satisfactory.",support
"Also, my sister got the exact same laptop (since they were so cheap) and after 8 months, the screen split in half just from everyday use.",display
After 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off.,display
"It was still working, but there was nothing on the screen.",display
"The screen is framed by half- to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary, reduces the screen size and increases the bulk.",display
Keyboard could use some trimming.,keyboard
"Did I mention everything about it, from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK?",keyboard
I especially like the backlit keyboard.,keyboard

I hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it.,display
The keyboard is too slick.,keyboard

No bloatware from third party parasites to uninstall.,software
The big deal with this was Windows 7.,os
The retina###display is fantastic.,display
The glare of the glossy-retina###display is unbearable.,display
Fantastic for the price - just wish it the keys were illuminated.,keyboard
Windows runs very poorly.,os
awesome price for a laptop that lasts more than 8 hours without recharging!,battery
Hate Windows 8.1!,os

You also have to press firmly on the keys.,keyboard

They were excellent to handle our return and post our refund back into our account the next day.,support
Fired up and worked for the first day and then the display died on my wife while she was taking a timed test.,display

The keyboard is a little wonky with having to use the Function button to get the F-keys but with how infrequently i use those it is a non-issue.,keyboard

The battery life is a joke and it's causing other problems.,battery

It was nearly impossible to find a laptop that had A) a side keyboard.,keyboard
The only con is Windows effin 8.,os
Still giving it a 5 star rating because it is fast and a nice sized screen.,display
Battery doesn't last long web###browsing (2.5 hours maybe).,battery

Only downfall is the preloaded McAfee and other software.,software

Dealing with HP support is a ridiculous and painful experience.,support

They are loud and clunky but I figured I'd get used to it.,mouse
"I purchased a  Dell###Inspiron I3531-1200BK and so far I love it, this model has a true life monitor, which is worth the extra bucks.",display
Would be a very nice laptop if the mousepad worked properly.,mouse
It was not responsive at all to touch.,mouse
"And while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work, your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse.",mouse
The 'A' key became jammed so that sometimes it wouldn't press in.,keyboard
"It has a decent feel to it, sharp display and is fast enough.",display
The biggest problem I have is the right side and top of the touchpad is unresponsive.,mouse
"I have updated the drivers and tweeked every feature available, but nothing has helped.",mouse
"Also, the touchpad is almost 'sticky', which kind of defeats the purpose of a touchpad.",mouse
But now I am having battery problems.,battery
Most of the things about the laptop is awesome except the touchpad.,mouse
The Windows 8.1 used to boot in just 2s and that was freaking awesome.,os
"But the  touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever I am typing, my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it's really annoying.",mouse
"I prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad, i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else.",mouse
A smaller touchpad would make life easier for Computer Science students or IT people much more easier.,mouse
"Unless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop, don't buy this.",mouse
"The touchpad hasn't worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning, I thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads I've worked with have some inherent oddities.",mouse
"This one however, is now very loose and I have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work, Then suddenly, I can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own.",mouse
"Today, it hasn't worked at all more than it has.",mouse
Can run CS:GO at 60 fps on low settings.,display

"I use a wireless mouse, but the touch pad and the ""red button"" in the middle that works like a little ""joystick"" also work fine.",mouse
"The screen is good, the whole things is very light and doesn't run hot.",display
I put that free app on for word###processing and it works like a charm.,software
Dell support was awful to deal with.,support
The 8.1 windows is a major disappointment.,os
Operating a non touch###screen on this system is a royal pain!,os
The first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light- makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus.,display
The keyboard is backlit but you have to press the F5 key to turn it on.,keyboard
used 6 times black screen returned for refund,display
do not use the facial###recognition,software
Windows 8 is not supported by a lot of things!,os
"Price is great, wish it didn't have Windows 8, but that is an opinion.",os
Great battery life.,battery

"I love the new high retina###display, and because this computer lacks a disc player it makes it significantly lighter.",display
Good battery life.,battery
Great color on screen.,display
It has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp.,display
I have to admit that the operating system is different and does take time to learn but I like it.,os
The touchpad is a little &quot;clunky&quot; for my taste; I use a small external mouse with laptops  in any event.,mouse
I also found the track pad irritating until I disabled &quot;pinch zoom.&quot;,mouse
Battery life is great - though it is new.,battery

The screen definition is superb and it fires up super quick and same to close down.,display
The screen has an extremely high resolution that I'm very pleased with.,display
My daughter's MacBook###Air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago.,battery
It took 3 days to make an appointment at the local Apple###store.,support
"I'm not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand $129 for a new battery, $39 to replace it and $139 for a new keyboard.",support
I could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so I went to the Apple###store myself and asked for a manager.,support
He explained to me the battery expansion is 'normal'.,support
Apple doesn't cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their Apple Care.,support
The battery is simply considered 'consumable' and NOT covered.,support
I asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the MacBook###Air on the internet with the description that Apple doesn't consider the product defective.,support
"His reply astonished me, looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said: 'Make sure you have your facts straight before you smear!",support
He didn't specify who are 'they' but from the tone of his voice and his 6'5' posture it indicated something between the SWAT team and a bunch of LAWYERS.,support
"It churns out HD content, runs without many flaws and I've yet to get a virus on a Mac since I started using the platform in the early 1990's.",display
I find it much easier to type on and much more durable.,keyboard
Battery Life- My battery life is really good with this laptop and I have had no problems with it thus far.,battery
I can usually go about 10 hours before I get down to 10% battery life.,battery
The touchscreen and 2-in-1 capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes.,display
"It's also incredibly light, has a battery that can last for days, and looks like a piece of art.",battery
2. Keyboard is great,keyboard
I wanted a simple Full HD display and this one does its job,display
2. Viewing###angles are not great.,display
5. I found the track pad not great.,mouse

It flickers briefly to green before the light goes out.,keyboard
I still can't pair it.,keyboard
I don't want to carry around a bluetooth keyboard for a computer whose keyboard is nonfunctional.,keyboard

"Either way, highly annoying.",mouse
"Love the 360 degree rotation and the touch###screen works great, but a little bit of a learning###curve there too, as sometimes I have to tap a few times to get the exact location I need...",display
overall it is just my learning a few things than any downfall with the laptop (the mouse was the only negative I could really see)...,mouse
I loved playing with it and the touchscreen was great for the windows 8 platform.,display
It's a great product and would recommend to anyone looking for a transformer or large touchscreen.,display

The backlit keyboard is a nice touch especially.,keyboard

"Furthermore, Mac###OS###X Mountain Lion's Gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans, which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed.",os
"The keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back-lit, which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing (Typing?).",keyboard
"Overall, the screen resolution, though non-retina, is sufficient for normal web###browsing and work.",display
"The glass track pad is large enough for Apple's highly acclaimed multi-touch gestures for scrolling through web###pages with two fingers, zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers, accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers.",mouse
"For Windows users switching to a Mac, you can also enable right clicking (known to apple as secondary click) in the system preferences&gt; Mouse and enabling right clicking.",mouse
The Mac app###store and iTunes store are phenomenal.,software

The processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly.,software
"Pros:  o It usually runs very smoothly, but Apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers.",support
o It has an extended battery life.,battery
"Cons:  o Some people don't enjoy the way the processing system runs, but don't have any issues with getting it to function.",os
Battery doesn't hold up to what it said in the description but I got it refurb'd and I imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price (Just a guess).,battery
Screen is too small to read and almost impossible to touch  with a normal adult finger.,display
The brightest screen setting appeared dim in normal room light.,display
Keyboard is flimsy and mediocre at best.,keyboard

The simple look of icons and format makes it easy to navigate through programs and download files.,os
And apple was happy to install the latest osx for free!,support
The online customer###service was awful.,support
Gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile.,support
No one would ever answer my question as to why I couldn't get another new Macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my Macbook was still under warranty.,support
"As a matter of fact, no matter how many times I asked that question, the employees I spoke purposely ignored it.",support
