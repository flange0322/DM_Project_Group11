I purchased this case,miscellaneous
because it looked very functional...,miscellaneous
To my surprise the rivets popped out and the zipper broke about two weeks into it's use.,quality
I have never been disappointed by a Sampsonite product until now.,miscellaneous
I have written to them,customer_service
and received no communication in return!,customer_service
I bought,miscellaneous
this case for Dell Inspiron E1505,miscellaneous
(15. 4 ''),miscellaneous
screen.,miscellaneous
It was way too small.,size_fit
"This case has an inner pocket,",compartments
which is the actual spot for the laptop,miscellaneous
to slip in.,miscellaneous
I will say,miscellaneous
it can only fit a 14 '' screen.,size_fit
I ended up,miscellaneous
"putting my laptop outside the inner pocket,",size_fit
which barely fit.,size_fit
I wish,miscellaneous
the manufacturer noticed this problem and not listed for any 15 '' + screens.,miscellaneous
"The case itself looks pretty high quality,",quality
but it's too thin.,size_fit
Getting the laptop in and out of the case is a huge hassle,size_fit
requiring both hands and lots,miscellaneous
of pulling.,miscellaneous
I have a 15. 4 '' Widescreen Dell Dimensions 1501.,miscellaneous
"It fits in there snug,",size_fit
"but as I stated above, getting the computer in and out is pain",size_fit
"(my wife is trying to convince me to return it,",miscellaneous
"but I'm too lazy,",miscellaneous
I think,miscellaneous
we'll just keep it).,miscellaneous
"Also,",miscellaneous
"if you have a wireless mouse,",size_fit
it bulges out.,size_fit
"Again, it has to do with the case",size_fit
being so thin.,size_fit
To some this characteristic may be very desirable,miscellaneous
"because the case is very low profile,",miscellaneous
but,miscellaneous
if you have perfiferals like a wireless mouse or a A/C adapter,miscellaneous
"that is more than an inch thick,",miscellaneous
it bulges out.,miscellaneous
"There's padding, of course,",protection
so your periferals probably will not be damaged...,protection
it just looks kinda funny.,looks
Functionality wise : awesome!,miscellaneous
"Has room for a lot of stuff,",size_fit
"and keeps the computer really protected,",protection
and that's the most important feature a case,miscellaneous
like that can have.,miscellaneous
"Doesn't look shiny and fancy, though,",looks
and it's something,miscellaneous
I look,miscellaneous
for in everything I buy.,miscellaneous
"But it varies from a person to another, obviously.",miscellaneous
Anyway I recommend.,miscellaneous
Very happy with the Samsonite L35 Notebook Case.,miscellaneous
Fits my MacBook with plenty of room.,size_fit
"Lots of pokets for my mouse, mouse pad, and accessories.",compartments
Just the right size,size_fit
for what I wanted.,miscellaneous
I purchased this rolling bag about six months ago.,miscellaneous
I travel frequently for work,miscellaneous
and depend on this bag,miscellaneous
to get me through airports and into and out of schools.,miscellaneous
and an airline agent showed me how to push the little button in the rear compartment,miscellaneous
to free the mechanism.,miscellaneous
Picture lots of people,miscellaneous
waiting as I unzipped the bag,miscellaneous
"to fool with the handle on shuttle buses, in airline aisles, etc..",miscellaneous
Then last week,miscellaneous
as a bus driver lifted it.,miscellaneous
I am going to contact Kensington about a refund,miscellaneous
because the bag is still under warrantee.,miscellaneous
I do not want a replacement,miscellaneous
unless the bag has been redesigned.,miscellaneous
I really liked that vertical design of this bag,size_fit
because it could be pulled down aisles in planes.,miscellaneous
I've used this once,miscellaneous
and it really didn't meet my expectations.,miscellaneous
I've been,miscellaneous
looking for a carry on bag,miscellaneous
that works for me,miscellaneous
and this isn't it.,miscellaneous
"Besides that, it's already",quality
starting to fall apart.,quality
There were several things,miscellaneous
I liked about this bag.,miscellaneous
Shoe storage on each side of the handle is a smart use of space.,compartments
The pockets made sense as well.,compartments
So nice organization in this bag I returned it,miscellaneous
because I just didn't like the look,looks
and needed more room for clothing and less for files.,compartments
This bag might be better suited to men then women.,miscellaneous
Just personal preference.,miscellaneous
I needed a laptop bag with wheels,miscellaneous
since I was tired of carrying around my heavy bookbag at the airport,miscellaneous
"... this one is great,",miscellaneous
"so many compartments,",compartments
"the wide-set wheels help prevent it from tipping over,",miscellaneous
and the handle is comfortable.,handles
"My only complaint is the finishing strip on the back side at the base came off very quickly,",quality
but I didn't really care that much.,miscellaneous
I 've,miscellaneous
been looking for a carry-on bag,miscellaneous
"that would accommodate my laptop, some clothing and personnel items.",miscellaneous
This is a well made bag,quality
and is a dream to roll thru the airport.,miscellaneous
It has many little compartments to pack almost anything.,compartments
A separate center compartment unzips to pull out the laptop for security at the airport.,compartments
I had been using a laptop backpack,miscellaneous
to carry my computer and peripherals,miscellaneous
which got extremely heavy after long periods,miscellaneous
of hauling around.,miscellaneous
The price is great,price
compared to other bags with these same features.,price
First time I have,miscellaneous
been dissappointed with a product from Amazon.,miscellaneous
Appearantly others are,miscellaneous
having the same problem with a 17 '' laptop not fitting in the compartment.,size_fit
My laptop is a standard size in the market.,miscellaneous
The bag may look good,looks
but that doesn't help if laptop doesn't fit.,size_fit
Totally dissappointed with SwissGear and Amazon.,customer_service
Like a dummy I ordered it after reading,miscellaneous
that it doesn't fit some of the 17 '' models.,size_fit
I have an HP,miscellaneous
and it doesnt fit.,size_fit
On the plus side it does have a lot of nooks and crannies to put stuff in.,compartments
Just disappointed to find out my laptop doesn't fit.,size_fit
Need to leave it unzipped.,miscellaneous
Just build it a tad bit bigger,size_fit
and send my one for my idea.,miscellaneous
You'll have the best on the market!,miscellaneous
Nice try ` eh,miscellaneous
I was really excited to get this backpack,miscellaneous
because I had been carefully searching for a backpack,miscellaneous
that had to fit my 17 inch laptop.,size_fit
I received my SwissGear backpack,miscellaneous
all the compartments,compartments
it had,miscellaneous
"In the stores, this backpack would have been at least double the price.",price
"But,",miscellaneous
when I tried to fit my laptop in the compartment,size_fit
"it was supposed to go in,",size_fit
it didn't fit.,size_fit
I was really disappointed,miscellaneous
because everything else about this backpack was really nice.,miscellaneous
I was able to fit it in another compartment,size_fit
"which fits snug,",size_fit
but it doesn't have the padding or strap,handles
that is supposed,miscellaneous
to hold it in place.,miscellaneous
I did decide to just keep the backpack,miscellaneous
because of all of it's other features and other uses,miscellaneous
I have for it and it's ability,compartments
to hold my laptop in another compartment.,compartments
My 15. 6 '' HP Pavilion dv6-1360US,miscellaneous
(14. 9 `` X10. 15 `` X1.33 ''),miscellaneous
barely fit inside the protective slot for laptop in this bag!,size_fit
"When I put my laptop in the protective slot,",size_fit
"the laptop get very close to the zipper,",size_fit
and the laptop pushes against the top of the bag,size_fit
(I can see laptop corners through the bag).,size_fit
I have to be VERY careful to zip it to make sure,size_fit
that the zipper does not scratch my laptop.,size_fit
I am a little worried,miscellaneous
about carrying weight in the bag,miscellaneous
because it will press against the laptop.,miscellaneous
"It is big enough for my laptop,",size_fit
but does not have any cushion on the sides,miscellaneous
(there is a little cushion at the bottom).,miscellaneous
I may put my laptop here,miscellaneous
by adding some cushion,miscellaneous
if I feel too uncomfortable,miscellaneous
about putting my laptop in the protective slot.,miscellaneous
"Other than this, the bag appears to be rugged and well made.",quality
We initially had trouble,miscellaneous
unzipping the bag,miscellaneous
because some zipper teeth were not aligned.,miscellaneous
But,miscellaneous
"after we pushed them in,",miscellaneous
it works fine.,miscellaneous
"As other reviewers noticed,",miscellaneous
the mp3 slot is inside the bag.,compartments
Don't know how useful that it.,compartments
This is a well constructed product,quality
made of quality materials.,quality
The color is a true red,looks
as I thought,miscellaneous
it would be,miscellaneous
and not a hot pink as it appears in the ad.,looks
I have read a lot of different opinions,miscellaneous
about what size laptop fits in it.,size_fit
I have a Sony Vaio,miscellaneous
that measures 15?1/8 inches long,miscellaneous
and it fits nicely.,size_fit
I'm not sure,size_fit
that it would fit,size_fit
if it were much longer.,size_fit
It has many pockets for just about anything,compartments
you might want to carry,compartments
while traveling.,compartments
Not sure,miscellaneous
why I had to pay more for it than the blue or black?,price
Crap.,miscellaneous
"The "" leather "" is already peeling,",quality
and the straps are small..,handles
I can barely sling it over my shoulder.,handles
It will fit a lap top.. and that is about it.,size_fit
Head to TJ Maxx/Ross,miscellaneous
and find something better,miscellaneous
"This is a nice big bag, and super cheap,",price
but I wanted something,miscellaneous
that wasn't so obviously plastic.,quality
I also didn't like the stitching.,quality
Just looked cheap.,quality
Sent it back.,miscellaneous
"Decently sized bag, a bit taller",size_fit
than I had anticipated.,size_fit
Serves its purpose just fine,miscellaneous
and I'm content with the look of it.,looks
The biggest problem is the straps.,handles
You can easily scrape/burn yourself,handles
"if you're not careful,",handles
or it'll hurt,handles
if it digs into your shoulder the wrong way.,handles
Like others,miscellaneous
"have mentioned, it does smell.",miscellaneous
Protip : Do not leave a ziploc of crackers in there for more than a day or two.,miscellaneous
It will acquire the smelly essence of this bag,miscellaneous
when you later retrieve it.,miscellaneous
"You will taste it,",miscellaneous
and you will not like it.,miscellaneous
It looks exactly like the picture,looks
and works great.,miscellaneous
Has a couple pockets,compartments
inside that are convenient,compartments
and is definitely large enough,size_fit
to hold such a large laptop.,size_fit
Definitely a great value!!!,price
This bag is great,miscellaneous
because it works for a larger laptop.,size_fit
"Also, it has a zipper,",compartments
so you don't have to worry about things,miscellaneous
falling out of the bag.,miscellaneous
I use this daily at work,miscellaneous
because I often have to change meeting rooms/work areas.,miscellaneous
"This bag comfortably fits a laptop, notebooks, pens, etc..",size_fit
"It also has little metal "" feet "" so",miscellaneous
that the bag will sit upright,miscellaneous
when you put it on the floor.,miscellaneous
"The outside pocket is handy,",compartments
"but it also has pockets inside for 3 pens, and then 2 larger pockets,",compartments
which I use for my iphone and smaller items.,miscellaneous
There's a zippered pocket inside as well.,compartments
"I have a 17 "" monitor",miscellaneous
and looked everywhere for a case,miscellaneous
that would work.,miscellaneous
This one works great,miscellaneous
and looks cute.,looks
"I want to be clear,",miscellaneous
the vendor,miscellaneous
that I purchased this hunk of junk from stood up for it,miscellaneous
and supplied a perfect replacement at no extra charge.,miscellaneous
As far as the Case Logic bag,miscellaneous
though I was severely disappointed.,miscellaneous
I researched for a long time to find what I thougt,miscellaneous
would be a good bag for my needs.,miscellaneous
This bag was it,miscellaneous
until I received it.,miscellaneous
It came in with a defective zipper,quality
"and I tried twice to contact the manufacturer Case Logic,",customer_service
and they never even responded.,customer_service
This from a consumer standpoint really turned me off from even considering a Case Logic in the future.,customer_service
I will also never recommend their product to anyone.,miscellaneous
I will however say the Samsonite replacement,miscellaneous
that the vendor sent,miscellaneous
me was great,miscellaneous
and it worked really well on my trip.,miscellaneous
Quality was the factor,quality
"and the zippers on the Case Logic were substandard,",quality
so be careful,miscellaneous
when considering their product.,miscellaneous
was walking down the sidewalk.,miscellaneous
The bag swung down,miscellaneous
"and hit the pavement on one corner,",miscellaneous
denting in the corner of my laptop.,protection
"Now, I did have a laptop, battery, and a few notebooks/books in the bag,",miscellaneous
but I didn't feel,miscellaneous
that it was significantly overloaded or heavy.,miscellaneous
"Upon closer examination, it appeared",miscellaneous
that the sewing/seam,quality
attaching the strap to the bag,quality
"is minimal, and probably not very durable",quality
(the strap on the other side was also halfway torn out).,miscellaneous
I was also disappointed,protection
the padding underneath was not very effective in protecting my laptop.,protection
"Overall, its a pretty nice-looking bag, but the seams",looks
where the strap attaches to the bag are one pretty significant flaw... just not a durable design.,quality
"If you do decide to purchase this bag,",miscellaneous
be sure to keep,miscellaneous
it loaded very lightly.,miscellaneous
"I just bought an Acer Aspire TimelineX 13 '',",miscellaneous
and the laptop fits perfect there.,size_fit
The case design is the most comfortable,size_fit
that I've had.,miscellaneous
The mesh pocket is very useful for the laptop's large power brick.,compartments
The only downside is that before 2 weeks of very mild use,quality
(and only used it to transport the laptop one time from NY to Boston and back),miscellaneous
and one of the corners already got ripped.,quality
Looks like,quality
they're not very durable.,quality
I 'm,miscellaneous
including a pic.,miscellaneous
This laptop case from Case Logic is nice for a non-fancy leathery kind.,miscellaneous
"It is a 13-14 inch case, sadly a little too small for my Toshiba.",size_fit
"My Dell would be fine in it, though.",size_fit
It is black and gray with lime green.,looks
The handle is adjustable,handles
and I think,miscellaneous
"it would do well in the rain,",miscellaneous
as it seems,miscellaneous
the rain would roll right off of it.,miscellaneous
"Overall, a nice well-made product for its level.",quality
The messenger bag has a place for every thing,compartments
and for the price it is a great value.,price
but I would feel this about any product,miscellaneous
made of the same material.,quality
"The bag closes up very nice and is not baggie or sloppy looking,",looks
"it has good form,",looks
that's important to me.,miscellaneous
The function of the bag and its clean lines are well thought out.,looks
Over all a really good purchases.,miscellaneous
It was very small and tight.,size_fit
I really did not like it.,miscellaneous
The pink flowers look really fake and cheap.,looks
I have a case on my 13 inch macbook and its very hard,size_fit
to close it.,size_fit
When I got this case I got it,miscellaneous
because it said,size_fit
it would fit a 13-14 inch Notebook Laptop Computer.,size_fit
I have a 14 inch,size_fit
and it does not fit.,size_fit
I can not zip it shut.,size_fit
"Otherwise the sleeve looks nice, is pretty",looks
and seems to be in good condition,looks
but I gave it 2 stars,miscellaneous
because I was misled,miscellaneous
into purchasing this item,miscellaneous
and it doesn't even fit my laptop.,size_fit
When I received the carrying case I thought,miscellaneous
it was very cute.,looks
It looks exactly,looks
as it appears in the picture.,looks
If you like bright pink then you,looks
'll love this!,looks
It sorta looks like a sticker with japanese design to it.,looks
I have to get use to the bright pink...,looks
it looks like it cheapens the look in a way.,looks
But I did receive some compliments about the bag -,miscellaneous
the japanese design is an eye catcher with the bright pink.,looks
I purchased the package deal,price
($ 67,price
which is a good deal,price
compared to the one item for $ 50,price
you get from the apple store),price
...,miscellaneous
"the carrying side bag, case sleeve, pink rubber keyboard cover",looks
(which I love!,looks
It's a purple pink not too bright).,looks
"We have a Macbook Air and a Pro, both 13 '',",miscellaneous
and we bought two of this sleeve.,miscellaneous
One zipper isn't as smooth,quality
"when it meets the corner,",quality
but that's not a problem,miscellaneous
if handled with care.,miscellaneous
I love my pink floral carrying case for my Mac book.,looks
It fits perfectly,size_fit
and provides padding for travel.,protection
"It's also stylish,",looks
and matches my pink plastic cover for the laptop.,looks
It fits nicely into a backpack,size_fit
without a lot of bulk.,size_fit
This case is awful.,miscellaneous
The bottom has no way,quality
of staying on.,quality
Its ridiculous...,miscellaneous
The styrofoam feet are going to fall off instantly.,quality
The material,quality
it is made of seems,quality
"like it would make a good case,",quality
but I really don't understand,miscellaneous
why there is no way the make,size_fit
"the bottom part "" snap "" on.",size_fit
Extremely disappointed...,miscellaneous
"This case looks and feels great,",looks
but is not too good for protection.,protection
"My laptop usually just sits on my desk,",miscellaneous
"which is great for this case, but the first time",miscellaneous
"I decided to take my laptop with me,",miscellaneous
"and placed it in a sleeve inside my backpack,",miscellaneous
the case,quality
developed cracks all over,quality
and part of it chipped off.,quality
But at 1/4 the price of the Speck cases,price
"that I also have,",miscellaneous
I guess,price
you get,price
what you pay for.,price
Update :,miscellaneous
"after less than six months, all of the rubber feet fell off",quality
and the bottom piece cracked to the point,quality
that it no longer would stay on.,quality
Went back to a Speck case about a month ago,miscellaneous
and couldn't be happier.,miscellaneous
It's a nice color,looks
and has effectively protected my macbook.,protection
"However, I've been",miscellaneous
trying to remove it to clean my computer,size_fit
and it's really difficult for it to come off.,size_fit
I was only able to remove the bottom.,size_fit
Heads up!,miscellaneous
"This case is a gorgeous, bright green color.",looks
"It's not the most well made, and the last time",quality
I bought it,quality
it developed a few cracks after a month or two of use.,quality
There were a couple sharp areas of plastic,quality
I had to file down.,quality
"However, I bought the case again",miscellaneous
when my old one wore out,quality
(about 7 months after I bought it),quality
because it's cheap,price
and does,price
what I want it to for the price.,price
"Plus, a lot of the more expensive cases aren't as bright as this one.",looks
I am fussy about everything.,miscellaneous
I love this cover.,miscellaneous
"It clips on easily,",size_fit
"the color is gorgeous Tiffany blue/green,",looks
it has a nice satin outer and hard inner side.,looks
The apple lite shows through,looks
if that is a concern for you.,miscellaneous
I got this from TopCase in record time.,customer_service
It arrived two days,customer_service
after I ordered it,customer_service
and was in excellent condition.,customer_service
"This bag might look nice,",looks
but it is of terrible quality.,quality
"After emailing them several times,",customer_service
they still wouldn't refund me,customer_service
because they claimed,customer_service
that their warranty lasts only 1 month.,customer_service
Who wants a laptop case,miscellaneous
that's only guaranteed to last one month?,miscellaneous
"This case is such a waste of money,",price
it would be much more worth,miscellaneous
it to spend a little more,miscellaneous
to get a case,miscellaneous
that lasts.,miscellaneous
Very fast shipping.,customer_service
Does not worth 25 $.,price
Rather spend 5 more dollars,miscellaneous
and get a better quality bag than this trash.,quality
It doesnt even look as sophisticate,looks
as shown in picture ;,looks
it look like my 2 years old sister's bag.,looks
This bag does not fit my laptop.,size_fit
The pocket inside for the laptop would fit a tablet best.,size_fit
I have a 15 inch screen,miscellaneous
and it's the only thing,miscellaneous
I can fit in the bag.,miscellaneous
"The bag is lovely and true to the pic,",looks
but make sure,miscellaneous
you know your computer size first,size_fit
before you get caught up in how cute the bag looks,looks
like I did LOL,miscellaneous
"I purchased this for work,",miscellaneous
as my other one didnt allow much room,miscellaneous
to keep paper work or folders in it with the laptop.,miscellaneous
"However, I wish",miscellaneous
they had an outer extended compartment for my power plug.,compartments
"If i try to put the power cord in as well,",size_fit
the bag looks bulky and doesnt close right.,size_fit
For now i have the power cord in the little red bag,miscellaneous
"that comes with it,",miscellaneous
but I carry it seperate.,miscellaneous
Id recommend this to anyone,miscellaneous
who doesnt plan,miscellaneous
"on carrying much else than their laptop, some pens and a notebook,",size_fit
which the cord will fit in the other side no problem.,size_fit
This would be more of a personal laptop bag,miscellaneous
"The price was good,",price
and it fits my 14 inch Toshiba perfectly.,size_fit
It looks good,looks
It is lightweight.,quality
It does come with a shoulder strap.,handles
I picked this bag,miscellaneous
because it had cushioning on the inside for extra protection.,protection
The only thing,compartments
I would have liked,compartments
is an outside pocket.,compartments
But that is minor.,miscellaneous
Love the color.,looks
I bought this case with the intent,miscellaneous
that it would protect my computer.,protection
"It did the complete opposite,",protection
and now the paint on the front part of my computer has worn off in two spots.,miscellaneous
The front zipper,miscellaneous
where the charger is placed,miscellaneous
"(as pictured in the photo),",miscellaneous
"wore a hole through the padding,",quality
and started to scratch my computer.,quality
Avoid this case.,miscellaneous
The good :,miscellaneous
and good,looks
looking sleeve.,looks
I loved it,miscellaneous
when I first opened it.,miscellaneous
I chose this sleeve over the other for the possibility,miscellaneous
of sticking the power cord into the side pocket in a rush situation.,compartments
The bad and the ugly.,miscellaneous
"As soon as I put my laptop in the sleeve, I noticed",miscellaneous
that the sleeve has hidden on the inside two loops,miscellaneous
that can be pulled out,miscellaneous
and used,miscellaneous
to carry the the case with your hands.,miscellaneous
"Neat idea, except that those two loops are attached to the inside of the case with two thick metallic buttons.",miscellaneous
"And guess what,",miscellaneous
"as you slide your laptop in and out of the sleeve,",miscellaneous
"they rub against the exterior of the laptop regularly,",protection
making it ripe for scratches and marks.,protection
Just what I needed for my delicate ultrabook.,miscellaneous
Thankfully Amazon has easy returns and this one is going back for sure!,miscellaneous
The sleeve gives a good protection,protection
and looks rugged enough,quality
to be used in backpacks or suitcases.,miscellaneous
It's light padded,miscellaneous
but I didn't expect a huge protection from shocks or hits by this kind of sleeves.,protection
The downside,miscellaneous
(that costed two stars to this review),miscellaneous
is,miscellaneous
that there are two small handles with metallic fastener,handles
that are normally,handles
stowed inside the sleeve.,handles
The fasteners are in direct contact with the laptop,handles
so they might end up,miscellaneous
scratching it.,miscellaneous
"Not much to say about this,",miscellaneous
it's a fairly basic neoprene sleeve.,miscellaneous
Steel zipper glides are kept away from scratching your laptop by internal gussets of neoprene.,protection
The external pocket is fairly big.,compartments
"Mine is black on the outside and lime green inside, an attractive combination.",looks
"The sleeve is slightly too big for a new 13 "" Macbook Pro.",size_fit
"While it's not exactly a "" custom fit "",",size_fit
it works fine.,size_fit
No reason to spend any more than this.,price
This is a nice neoprene sleeve for my MacBook Air.,miscellaneous
The fit is perfect,size_fit
and it gives a nice amount of padding.,protection
"It probably won't protect my laptop from a fall,",protection
but it's great for day-to-day protection,protection
while my laptop is either at my home or tucked inside my briefcase.,miscellaneous
My only complaint is the interior color -,looks
the black case has a BRIGHT lime green interior.,looks
"I don't care for it,",miscellaneous
but no one really sees it.,miscellaneous
"Overall, a good value.",price
"This might be a good case for other 13. 3 inch laptop,",miscellaneous
but it definitely does,size_fit
not fit a Macbook Air 13. 3,size_fit
(2013 model).,miscellaneous
The case is so small,size_fit
that it's difficult for me to put Macbook Air into it,size_fit
and I could hardly take it out of the case.,size_fit
I ordered this sleeve for my Lenovo Ideapad.,miscellaneous
The case was TOO SMALL.,size_fit
"The computer fit,",size_fit
but just barely.,size_fit
"It's a hassle getting it in or out of the sleeve,",size_fit
and the seams began to tear within a week of receiving it.,quality
"It's not leather,",quality
and it doesn't look like it.,quality
"I do like the soft material inside,",quality
and the magnetic closure is slick.,miscellaneous
"Although it pops open regularly,",miscellaneous
because the case is too small for the computer,size_fit
it is advertised,size_fit
to fit in the title.,size_fit
"I got this as a gift,",miscellaneous
"and I have the Lenovo IdeaPad U310,",miscellaneous
which it says,miscellaneous
is compatible.,miscellaneous
IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE.,miscellaneous
"The laptop doesn't fit inside,",size_fit
"it's too big by about 1/2in to even fit in the opening,",size_fit
not to mention having,miscellaneous
to fit the entire height of the computer inside.,size_fit
I'm going to have to buy one size bigger,size_fit
if it's available.,miscellaneous
It is a very nice-looking case,looks
and I hope,miscellaneous
one size bigger is available.,size_fit
Great!,miscellaneous
My MacBook Pro fits very tightly inside this sleeve so expect that,size_fit
to be a minor problem.,miscellaneous
Only one I can think of though.,miscellaneous
Very nice leather and quality product,quality
that is definitely worth the money.,price
Looks good and is easy to handle,looks
without slipping out of your hands.,miscellaneous
Also great protection with average use.,protection
Recommended.,miscellaneous
Right size.,size_fit
Good quality.,quality
Great price.,price
Don't look further.,miscellaneous
The Dell notebook is odd shape and leather sleeve,miscellaneous
"(US$ 60),",miscellaneous
or the nylon one,miscellaneous
(US$ 30),miscellaneous
offered by Dell are not superior to this one.,miscellaneous
